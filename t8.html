        A paragraph is a series of related sentences
         developing a central idea,
         called the topic.
        Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity:
        a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences
         that supports one central,
         unified idea.
        Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader argument.
