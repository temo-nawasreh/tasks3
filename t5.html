She likes to chase the soccer ball when I practice.
It is so funny to see her running down the field trying to catch the ball with her mouth.
It just won't fit!</pre>

            <pre>Once Sasha saved my life. When I was only 4 years old. I started to go into the street to get a ball that had rolled across the street. 
Of course I did not think to look for cars! Sasha got in front of me and knocked me backwards onto the sidewalk. 
I was mod until I saw the car go by where I would have been. Then I was so happy that Sasha was smarter than I was!</pre>
